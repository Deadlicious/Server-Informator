# Server Informator

Simple http-server utility for checking server status, which I made while learnt linux basics.

It is simple Apache-Nginx bundle which is used to show bash generated http page with information like load average, disk free space, RAM and CPU usage.

## WARNING! 
I only wrote install script. I checked it on fresh-new system and never tested it with installed apache/nginx. Check install.sh for info about modification in apache/nginx configs and cronjobs.
